# slushfind
Tool to search the parameter space for SLH-DSA

## Prior Work

This project is heavily based on (and is tested against) Scott Fluhrer's work at
https://github.com/sfluhrer/sphincs-param-set-search. This project allows
a greater variety of searches across the parameter set space of SLH-DSA.
